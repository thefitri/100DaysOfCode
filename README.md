### Day 1 | September 13, 2018

**Progress:** Created dropdown select menu.

**Thoughts:** I'm mostly working on project *"urbn"* (URL shortener and beyond) lately. It's refreshing to do something else for a change. This will eventually be absorbed into *urbn's* codebase for the user's current team selection, so technically it is still part of the project. Regardless, it's nice to be finally be doing a bit of fun with front-end.
