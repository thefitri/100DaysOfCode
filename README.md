# 100DaysOfCode

I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. Originally started by [@ka11away](https://twitter.com/ka11away), you can read more about it [here](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). Following is my log:

### Day 1 | September 13, 2018

**Progress:** Created dropdown select menu.

**Thoughts:** I'm mostly working on project *"urbn"* (URL shortener and beyond) lately. It's refreshing to do something else for a change. This will eventually be absorbed into *urbn's* codebase for the user's current team selection, so technically it is still part of the project. Regardless, it's nice to be finally be doing a bit of fun with front-end.

### Day 2 | September 14, 2018

**Progress:** Created expanding side menu.

**Thoughts:** Today's theme is similar to yesterday's, except this time it's purely CSS with no frameworks.

### Day 3 | September 15, 2018

**Progress:** Hover Effect Like Super Team Deluxe.

**Thoughts:** Had fun doing this. One thing that can be improved here is the keyframe path. Right now it's taking the shape of a diamond instead of a circle. There's also still a lot to learn on CSS grid and flexbox.

### Day 7 | September 19, 2018

**Progress:** Continued working on *urbn* dashboard. Tweaked CSS to be mobile first.
